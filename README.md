Hello everyone,  
I recently worked on a project that allows users to input a single word or sentence and receive a spell-checked version as output.  

The project features a simple interface where users can provide input, and with a click, it analyzes the text and provides the corrected spelling for any misspelled words as output.  

It is developed using Python, along with the tkinter library for the interface and the spellchecker library for spell checking.  

Key Features:  
- User-Friendly GUI for easy interaction  
- Spell Checking that identifies and corrects misspelled words  
- Error Handling with message boxes for unexpected issues
